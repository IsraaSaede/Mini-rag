# 🧠 mini-rag-app
A lightweight, modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Python. This project demonstrates how to combine document retrieval with large language models to answer user queries using custom, context-rich data.

# 🔍 What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that enhances a language model’s output by retrieving relevant information from external sources (e.g., local documents or databases). Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG systems search for context and then generate informed, accurate, and up-to-date responses.
